# Hi there!
My name is Peter Jeremiah from Nigeria (Lagos). I've been working on my as Front-End Developer since early October 2020. I'm passionate about open source projects, so I've created some projects as Front-end BR and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (soccer), to watch movies (film_strip) and series (tv), to read books (books), to listen to music (musical_note) and eventually I like to philosophize about life.
