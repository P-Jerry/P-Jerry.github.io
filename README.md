# Hi there! üòÅ 
My name is Peter Jeremiah from Nigeria (Lagos). I've been working on my as Front-End Developer since early October 2020. I'm passionate about open source projects, I'll create some projects as Front-end BR and I'll loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

## In my free time I like to:  
* Play and watch soccer, 
* Watch movies (film_strip) and series (tv)
* Read books (novels)
* Listen to music (musical_note)
* Eventually I like to philosophize about life.
